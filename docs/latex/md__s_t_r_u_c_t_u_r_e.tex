Looking at the file structure of a project like this can feel intimidating. This document describes the structure of this project, so you know where to find stuff.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily .github} contains files used by Git\+Hub to perform some actions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily .github/\+ISSUE\+\_\+\+TEMPLATE} contains the templates that are used for new \href{https://github.com/ZestCommunity/ZestCode/issues}{\texttt{ issues}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily docs} contains documentation and documentation generation config files
\item {\ttfamily firmware} contains static libraries that are used to compile Zest\+Code
\item {\ttfamily include} contains the header files
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily include/common} headers used in various parts of the project
\item {\ttfamily include/pros} headers that are distributed to user projects
\item {\ttfamily include/rtos} headers for the scheduler (Free\+RTOS)
\item {\ttfamily include/system} headers for low-\/level system functionality
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item {\ttfamily src} contains the source files
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily src/common} sources defining symbols used throughout the project
\item {\ttfamily src/devices} implementations of VEX device abstractions. Files prefixed with {\ttfamily vdml\+\_\+} indicate that the file makes use of the VDML
\item {\ttfamily src/rtos} sources, build scripts, and misc files of Free\+RTOS
\item {\ttfamily src/system} sources for low-\/level system functionality
\begin{DoxyItemize}
