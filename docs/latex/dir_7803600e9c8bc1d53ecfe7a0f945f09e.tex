\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
{\bfseries{Note\+: modifiying these files may break PROS or make PROS unstable}}

{\itshape This file serves as an introduction to how PROS uses Free\+RTOS if you\textquotesingle{}re just} {\itshape getting started with development of the PROS kernel. It also contains some} {\itshape notes from configuring Free\+RTOS to work with the V5.}

PROS 3 uses Free\+RTOS 9.\+0.\+0 to implement scheduling, queues, and lists -\/ the barebones of an operating system. In some respects, Free\+RTOS could be thought of as a C library that we have ported to the V5. It of course does more significant work that a typical application library. Since computer architectures are different and Free\+RTOS aims to work with many embedded architectures, some work must be done to let Free\+RTOS work with the hardware.

Free\+RTOS provides many demo projects and the developers recommend modifying one of the projects to suit the needs of the project. Since the V5 is Zynq-\/7000 board, we\textquotesingle{}re modifying the Cortex\+\_\+\+A9\+\_\+\+Zynq\+\_\+\+ZC702 demo.

You should read some of Free\+RTOS\textquotesingle{}s documentation and/or take an equivalent of Purdue\textquotesingle{}s CS250 (Computer Architecture) and CS354 (Operating Systems) for requisite background knowledge. For more info about the Zynq/\+A9 port, see Free\+RTOS\textquotesingle{}s documentation on \href{http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-Xilinx-Zynq.html}{\texttt{ Zynq}} and the \href{http://www.freertos.org/Using-FreeRTOS-on-Cortex-A-Embedded-Processors.html}{\texttt{ A9}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Modifications to Free\+RTOS}{Modifications to Free\+RTOS}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md25}
We\textquotesingle{}ve somewhat significantly refactored the Free\+RTOS kernel so that any Free\+RTOS functions used within PROS align with the PROS coding style. See refactor.\+tsv in this directory.

We\textquotesingle{}ve removed the use of {\ttfamily int32\+\_\+t} and {\ttfamily uint32\+\_\+t} from any public facing API since we felt it unnecessary. Additionally, all variables pertaining to ticks on the PROS internal or public facing APIs have become millisecond precision, and the conversion done immediately upon entering the functiion.
