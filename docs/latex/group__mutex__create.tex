Creates a new mutex type semaphore instance, and returns a handle by which the new mutex can be referenced.

Internally, within the Free\+RTOS implementation, mutex semaphores use a block of memory, in which the mutex structure is stored. If a mutex is created using \doxylink{group__c-rtos_ga475d096afa3abcc9a276ca9fa54bafdf}{mutex\+\_\+create()} then the required memory is automatically dynamically allocated inside the \doxylink{group__c-rtos_ga475d096afa3abcc9a276ca9fa54bafdf}{mutex\+\_\+create()} function. (see \href{http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+freertos.\+org/a00111.\+html}}). If a mutex is created using mutex\+\_\+create\+\_\+static() then the application writer must provided the memory. mutex\+\_\+create\+\_\+static() therefore allows a mutex to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.

Mutexes created using this function can be accessed using the \doxylink{group__apix_gaee36a9729a21b6ad0de78985a16c4f03}{sem\+\_\+wait()} and \doxylink{group__apix_gaa2048694c50246f193a40b7e00ed1756}{sem\+\_\+post()} macros. The \doxylink{group__c-rtos_ga67f8421ccecb58c807762494efe10c3a}{mutex\+\_\+recursive\+\_\+take()} and \doxylink{group__c-rtos_gaaf82d93cd652b6173372970018fdc02d}{mutex\+\_\+recursive\+\_\+give()} macros must not be used.

This type of semaphore uses a priority inheritance mechanism so a task \textquotesingle{}taking\textquotesingle{} a semaphore MUST ALWAYS \textquotesingle{}give\textquotesingle{} the semaphore back once the semaphore it is no longer required.

Mutex type semaphores cannot be used from within interrupt service routines.

See \doxylink{group__apix_ga83c9a6c93e3bfce8f36e3f32a6dc8c4b}{sem\+\_\+binary\+\_\+create()} for an alternative implementation that can be used for pure synchronisation (where one task or interrupt always \textquotesingle{}gives\textquotesingle{} the semaphore and another always \textquotesingle{}takes\textquotesingle{} the semaphore) and from within interrupt service routines.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If the mutex was successfully created then a handle to the created semaphore is returned. If there was not enough heap to allocate the mutex data structures then NULL is returned.
\end{DoxyReturn}
